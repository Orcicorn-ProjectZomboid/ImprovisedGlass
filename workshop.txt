title=Improvised Glass
description=You've survived the apocalypse. You've memorized the Wood Time TV Jingle. You've stolen countless cars, survived endless nights and you've scavenged your little heart out and yet, that elusive windshield or home window eludes you. Not anymore! Introducing "[b]Improvised Glass[/b]"
description=
description=Utilizing over 20 new recipes and a few new times, you can now take those destroyed glass shards you've found in the world (or smash some yourself) and utilize nothing more than your oven and a baking tray to create new glass panes.  Slather it up with some wood glue to repair existing windows, or frame it off a build a completely brand new window for your house.  Got a scalpel on hand? Perfect, now lets cut that pane down to size and give ourselves a brand new windshield or side window.

description=Life is just a little bit better with Improvised Glass. It is not meant to be a replacement for scavenging but more of a supplement. Maybe you already found 5 windows but the 6th is just no where to be found. No problem, build one!  Running out of decent windshields in your world? Why not just craft one and put an end to your headaches.  Just find the magazines scattered throughout the world to learn all the recipes and specialties.

description=[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
description=Take broken glass shards, smelt them in an over to get glass panes. Use glass panes to craft windows for your house and vehicles. Disassemble windows in a house for half the materials and in single-player you can even repair your home windows without replacing them.  Glass objects can be smashed to produce glass shards or pick them up off the ground.

description=[h1]!!! MULTIPLAYER WARNING !!![/h1]
description=There is a confirmed server bug in build 41.68 where picking up items from an Oven/Microwave causes them to disappear into the void. This is [u]not[/u] a bug with the addon when smelting glass in a pan, it is a bug within the game and I can not fix it.
description=
description=[b]The work around is quite simple[/b]:
description=Drag the cooked pan to the floor, then pick it up.  Now the server won't delete it and you're good to go.

description=[h1]Regarding Crafting Windows[/h1]
description=It is [b]strongly recommended[/b] that you craft then install 1 house window at a time. The game has an issue where when you craft more than you can carry it will automatically drop it on the ground. However, Windows don't have a floor icon or model because they were never intended to be crafted. If you craft more than you can carry you will end up with invisible windows on the ground doing nothing.
